Sakila & World Database Exercise Book

Databases Exercises Introduction 

This Exercise Book makes use of the Sakila and World databases which we have running for you in the cloud, please consult trainers on how to connect to these instances.
These exercises should provide a good test for your knowledge of Structured Query Language (SQL). 
Please work through this book at your own pace: it is more important that you use this book to enhance your SQL abilities than to speed through it as fast as you can without retaining anything.
You do not need to store the answers to each Exercise in this book, but you are free to use it as an extension of your notes, if you wish.
